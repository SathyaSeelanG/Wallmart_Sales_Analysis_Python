Walmart Sales Data Analysis
This repository contains Python code and data for analyzing Walmart sales data using regression. The goal of this project is to understand the factors that drive sales at Walmart stores and use this information to make data-driven business decisions.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine and install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/SathyaSeelanG/Wallmart_Sales_Analysis_Python.git
cd walmart-sales
pip install -r requirements.txt
Next, you will need to download the Walmart sales data from the Kaggle website and save it to the data directory.

Usage
To use this code, you can run the analysis.py script in your terminal:

Copy code
Wallmart_sales.py
This will run the regression analysis on the Walmart sales data and output the results to the console.

You can also modify the code to explore different aspects of the data or build more complex regression models.

Results
The regression analysis shows that store size, location, and promotional activities are the most important factors in driving Walmart sales. By using these insights to optimize store layouts, promotions, and inventory management, Walmart can improve its sales performance and increase customer satisfaction.
